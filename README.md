This web system project seeks to achieve an online video platform that provides users with various
types of video viewing, and users can leave bullet comments while watching. This system allows users
to upload their own videos as well as download videos that other users have uploaded. It supports users
to share videos to their social networking sites. The main purpose of developing this project is to provide
a platform for users to share and watch videos made by other users online. Establishing social networks
inside and outside the website and various interactions between users and the website will not only help
improve the user experience but also expand the user's social circle.
